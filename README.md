My temperature converter is a simple web-based application created using HTML, CSS, and Java.
It allows users to easily convert between Celsius, Fahrenheit,  with an interactive interface. 
The HTML structure defines the layout, CSS ensures a clean and responsive design, and Java handles the logic for accurate conversions.
